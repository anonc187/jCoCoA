jCoCoA
====

CoCoA is a toolbox for Discrete Constraint Optimization Problems. It contains a bunch of solvers and agents that are capable of solving DCOPs. It is designed to be setup from a Matlab set of operations that build and execute an experiment. Key concepts are Agents, Variables, Constraints and Solvers, which can be found in the corresponding packages. It is designed in such a way that any combination of solvers and constraints can easily be combined to quickly perform experiments with.
